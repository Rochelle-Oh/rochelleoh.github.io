      I used to make YouTube videos! Here are three of my best /  most recent videos. The first two are lookbooks (oh how I loved a lookbook!) with dynamic edits and no voiceover. The last is a studio vlog that is a longer-form and chatty, documenting about a few weeks of footage. With my videos, I always tried to have a balance between aesthetics, humour, earnestness and play, no matter the type of video it was. They were made to be mood-setting, comforting and inspirational, and I was always trying to do something different or unexpected. Editing was the part of the process I was most confident in; if I had no idea what I should document or couldn't properly explain my point or accidentally shot a whole scene out of focus, I could rely on my editing skills to pull the threads together. As they say, we'll fix it in post!

      Once I started working for not-for-profit label Music in Exile, I got to edit some campaign content for them in-between designing record covers and posters! Here are two behind-the-scenes interviews I edited. ~ <br>
      ❁ The first is a relaxed, informal interview with Maryos Syawish and Corey Kikos of Sleep D and Butter Sessions, discussing the process of creating their remix of Gordon Koang's track 'Y Dah'. <br>
      ❁ The second is a shorter social promo with Gordon and Paul Biel at non-profit fashion school The Social Studio, where a collaborative flag and custom suits were being designed for the musicians. <br>
      Both videos were shot with on the fly by the wonderful Nick McKinlay. With two people speaking in stream of consciousness in both videos, the editing pace was largely informed by the artists' natural speaking pace, leaving time for for thinking and processing while cutting out the um's and ah's. The diegetic music in the first video added an extra challenge to subtely condensing and rearranging different key thoughts and moments into a cohesive story 🤔

    <div class="title">My background 🧍🏻‍♀️ ~</div>
    <div class="caption">
      I’ve been editing videos since I started making nail tutorials in Windows Movie Maker in 2013. After moving to iMovie lookbooks and design vlogs in Premiere Pro, one of my videos made the rounds in the beginning of the pandemic, bringing new eyes and appreciation to the video-making skills I had cultivated over all those years and rapidly expanding the small audience I had garnered. As I got older I realised I didn’t want so much of my existence available online and decided to focus on my career in graphic design. This decision made my creative energy much more focused and sustainable, but I still have an itch to play with the kind of unique content that is only possible on YouTube, and get back into the kind of creative editing that made me fall in love with YouTube in the first place. 
    </div>
    <div class="title">What I can offer you 🫡 ~</div>
    <div class="caption">
     I’m familiar with the editing workflow, dealing with large amounts of raw footage (scripted and unscripted), and constructing it into a cohesive, enjoyable story with a confident tone and style. I’m a lover of film and watch a lot of YouTube (lol) so I have a confident approach to pacing and experimentation.  I’m comfortable colour grading, designing titles, creating thumbnails, listening to lots of copyright-free music, and navigating YouTube Studio. Working in design, I have no problem receiving critiques and offering feedback. As a freelancer, I’m also no stranger to managing my time, tasks and deadlines. A lot of my work requires me to collaborate remotely, so I’ve become a confident communicator and understand to make teamwork online an enjoyable process :-)
     <br><br>
    I’m fluent in the Adobe Suite, and so I’m most proficient in editing videos in Premiere Pro. However, I’m confident I can pick up the Final Cut workflow. I have extra skills in animation and subtitling videos, including multilingual videos, and I have experience running livestreams on YouTube, plus running a Patreon and an online shop! I also understand what it’s like to have a YouTube-sized digital footprint, and what it means to balance vulnerability and transparency with privacy and safety online. 
    <br><br>
    I’ve been a viewer for a few years, coming in and out of watching your channel like it’s an old familiar friend to me. We’re around the same age and have similar values, interests, and backgrounds so your content has always resonated with me. Thank you so much for creating a wonderful space online and taking the time to read my spiel!
