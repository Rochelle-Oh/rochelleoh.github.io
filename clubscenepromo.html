       A Stretch of the Imagination
      </div>

      <div class="project-description">
        My treatment responds to our Eurocentric perception of theatre that heroes Victorian nostalgia and witfully plays with the themes of the monologue that is ‘Stretch’. Referencing old playbills and the nature of the required content resulted in a type-based treatment and limited colour palette. Different from my usual style, it was a fun challenge to create a successful and appropriate treatment that still had my style injected into it.
